In this section we would like to fix some of the notation used throughout the rest of the text and remind the reader of some concepts which we will be important later on.
We will not give proofs for any statements; however we will point to the relevant literature in case one is unfamiliar with them.
\begin{definition}[Simplex Category]
    Let $\Delta$ be the category with
    \begin{itemize}
        \item objects the categories $[n]=\{0\to1\to\ldots\to n\}\subset\Nat$ for all $n\in\Nat$
        \item morphisms functors between these categories (which are exactly monotone increasing functions).
    \end{itemize}
    We call this category the \emph{simplex category $\Delta$}.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Augmented Simplex Category]
    Let $\Delta_+$ be the category with
    \begin{itemize}
        \item objects the categories $[n]$ for all $n\in\Nat_{n\geq-1}$ where $[-1]=\emptyset$ is the empty category
        \item morphisms functors between these categories (which again are exactly the monotone increasing functions).
    \end{itemize}
    We call this category the \emph{augmented simplex category $\Delta_+$}.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Simplicial Set]
    We set $\sSet=\Fun(\Delta^{\op},\Set)$ to be the \emph{category of simplicial sets}.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Nerve of an Ordinary Category]
    For a category $C$, we denote the composition $\Hom_{\Cat}(-,C)\circ i$ as $\Hom_{\Delta}(-,C)$, where $i:\Delta\xhookrightarrow{}\Cat$ is the inclusion as a full subcategory.
    Let $\N\colon\Cat\to\sSet$ be the functor that sends
    \begin{itemize}
        \item a category $C$ to the simplicial set $\Hom_{\Delta}(-,C)$
        \item a functor $F:C\to D$ to $\N(F)\colon\Hom_{\Delta}(-,C)\xrightarrow{F\circ -}\Hom_{\Delta}(-,D)$\;.
    \end{itemize}
    We then call $\N(C)$ the \emph{nerve of the category $C$}.
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
    The nerve functor $\N\colon\Cat\to\sSet$ is fully faithful and has a left adjoint $\ho\colon\sSet\to\Cat$ which we call the \emph{homotopy category} of a simplicial set.
    \begin{proof}[Reference]
        \cite[Proposition 1.2.2.1]{kerodon}
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
\begin{definition}
    We let $\Cat_{\Delta}$ denote the category of small categories enriched over $\sSet$.
    We call a category enriched over $\sSet$ a \emph{simplicial category}.

    We call a simplicial category $C$ \emph{tensored} if if for each $X\in C$ and $K\in\sSet$ there is an object $X\otimes K$ such that there is a natural isomorphism
    \begin{equation*}
        \Hom_C(X\otimes K,-)\cong\Hom_{\sSet}(K,\Hom_C(X,-))\;.
    \end{equation*}

    We call a simplicial category $C$ \emph{powered} if for each $Y\in C$ and $K\in\sSet$ there is an object $Y^K$ such that there is a natural isomorphism
    \begin{equation*}
        \Hom_C(-,Y^K)\cong\Hom_{\sSet}(K,\Hom_C(-,Y))\;.
    \end{equation*}
    We note that due to the functoriality of the right side, these extend to functors $-\otimes -:C\times\sSet\to C$ and $-^-:C\times\sSet^{\op}\to C$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Simplicial Model Category]
    A \emph{simplicial model category} is a simplicial category $C$ that is 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item tensored and powered
        \item equipped with a model structure
    \end{itemize} 
    such that for a cofibration $i:A\rightarrowtail B$ and a fibration $p:X\twoheadrightarrow Y$ in the model structure the induced map of simplicial sets
    \begin{equation*}
        \Hom_C(B,X)\to\Hom_C(A,X)\times_{\Hom_C(A,Y)}\Hom_C(B,Y)
    \end{equation*}
    is a fibration that additionally is a weak equivalence whenever $i$ or $p$ is a weak equivalence.
\end{definition}
\begin{construction}%[{\cite[Notation 2.4.3.1]{kerodon}}] TODO decide
    For $[n]\in\Delta$ we define a simplicial category $\C[n]$ as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the objects of $\C[n]$ are the elements of the set $\set{0,\ldots,n}$
        \item for $i,j\in\set{0,\ldots,n}$, the simplicial $\Hom$-objects are given by 
            \begin{equation*}
                \Hom_{\C[n]}(i,j)=\N(P_{i,j})
            \end{equation*}
            where $P_{i,j}$ is the partially ordered set of subsets of $\set{0,\ldots,n}$ which contain both $i$ and $j$ with the relation given by reverse inclusion
        \item for $i,j,k\in\set{0,\ldots,n}$ the composition is given by applying the nerve $\N(-)$ to the map
        \begin{align*}
                P_{i,j}\times P_{j,k}&\to P_{i,k}\\
                (I,J)&\mapsto I\cup J\;.
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
    For a morphism $[n]\to[m]\in\Delta$ we define
    \begin{equation*}
        \C[f]\colon\C[n]\to C[m]
    \end{equation*}
    which
    \begin{itemize}
        \item sends an object $i\in\C[n]$ to $f(i)\in\C[m]$
        \item for $i,j\in\C[n]$ induces a map between $\Hom$-objects by applying $\N(-)$ to the map
            \begin{align*}
                P_{i,j}&\to P_{f(i),f(j)}\\
                I&\mapsto f(I)
            \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}
    so we obtain a functor $\C[-]\colon\Delta\to\Cat_{\Delta}$.
\end{construction}
\begin{definition}[Homotopy Coherent Nerve]
    For a simplicial category $A$ we define the \emph{simplicial nerve (or homotopy coherent nerve) $\Nhc(A)$ of $A$} as $\Nhc(A)=\Hom_{\Cat_{\Delta}}(\C[-],A)$ and thus we obtain a functor $\Nhc\colon\Cat_{\Delta}\to\sSet$.
\end{definition}
We will also need the standard model structure on $\sSet$, the Quillen model structure. 
Whenever we speak of cofibrations, fibrations or weak equivalences between simplicial sets, we are referring to this model structure.
\begin{prop}[Quillen Model Structure on $\sSet$]
    There is a unique model structure on $\sSet$ where the cofibrations are the monomorphisms and the fibrant objects are Kan-complexes.

    The fibrations of this model structure are the maps having the right lifting property against the maps $\set{\Lambda_k^n\xhookrightarrow{}\Delta^n\mid 0\leq k\leq n}$.
    The weak equivalences are the maps which are weak equivalences in $\Top$ after geometric realization.

    We call this model structure the \emph{Quillen Model Structure on $\sSet$}.
    \begin{reference}
        \cite[Theorem 3.1.8 and Theorem 3.1.29]{cisinski_2019} and \cite[Chap. II, 3.1, Theorem 1]{Quillen1967}
    \end{reference}
\end{prop}
For completess sake we will also describe the Joyal model structure on $\sSet$, as it plays a similar role for \inftycats/ as the Quillen model structre does for Kan-complexes.
\begin{prop}[Joyal Model Structure on $\sSet$]
    The following two classes of maps endow $\sSet$ with a unique model structure:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cofibrations are the monomorphisms.
        \item The weak equivalences are the maps $A\to B$ such that for every \inftycat/ $C$ the induced map $\ho(\Fun(B,C))\to\ho(\Fun(A,C))$ is a categorical equivalence.
            Analogous to ordinary category theory, we also call these maps \emph{categorical equivalences}.
    \end{itemize}
    The fibrant objects of this model structure are the \inftycats/.

    We call this model structure the \emph{Joyal Model Structure on $\sSet$}.
    \begin{reference}
        \cite[Definition 3.3.7]{cisinski_2019}
    \end{reference}
\end{prop}
\begin{prop}
    Let $F\colon C\to D$ be a map between \inftycats/.
    Then the following are equivalent:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $F$ is a weak equivalence in the Joyal model structure
        \item $F$ is fully faithful and essentially surjective
        \item There exists a map $G\colon D\to C$ and invertible natural transformations $FG\simeq \id_D$ and $GF\simeq \id_C$.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{reference}
        \cite[Corollary 3.6.6 and Theorem 3.9.7]{cisinski_2019}
    \end{reference}
\end{prop}
\begin{prop}
    Let $A$ be a simplicial category such that for every pair of objects $X,Y\in A$ the simplicial set $\Hom_A(X,Y)$ is a Kan-complex.
    Then $\Nhc(A)$ is an \inftycat/.
    \begin{reference}
        \cite[Theorem 2.4.5.1]{kerodon}
    \end{reference}
\end{prop}
\begin{corollary}
    Let $M$ be a simplicial model category.
    Then the simplicial set $\Nhc(M^째)$ where $M^째$ denotes the restriction to cofibrant-fibrant objects is an \inftycat/.
    \begin{proof}
        The axioms of a simplicial model category imply that for every pair of objects $X,Y\in M^째$ the simplicial set $\Hom_{M^째}(X,Y)$ is a Kan-complex.
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}
\begin{definition}[Simplicial Localization] %TODO define localization CatLR Definition 7.1.2. and add existence
    Let $C$ be a simplicial set and $W\subset C$ be a simplicial subset.

    For a given \inftycat/ $D$, let $\Fun_W(C,D)\subset\Fun(C,D)$ be the full subcategory of functors $f\colon C\to D$ such that for every map in $u\in W_1$, $f(u)$ is invertible.
    Then a \emph{localization of $C$ by $W\subset C$} is an \inftycat/ $C[W^{-1}]$ together with a functor $\gamma\in\Fun_W(C, C[W^{-1}])_0$ such that for every \inftycat/ $D$, $\gamma$ induces an equivalence of \inftycats/
    \begin{equation*}
        \Fun(C[W^{-1}],D)\xrightarrow{\sim}\Fun_W(C,D)\;.
    \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}\label{prop:simpLocEssSurj}
    Let $C$ be a simplicial set and $W\subset C$ be a simplicial subset.
    The a simplicial localization exists, is essentially unique and the localization functor $\gamma\colon C\to C[W^{-1}]$ is essentially surjective.

    Furthermore, we can always assume $\gamma$ to be bijective on objects.

\begin{construction}[(Co)Slice Contraction]%TODO kerodon 4.3.5.12.
    Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism of simplicial sets.
    Then let $c\colon Y_{/f}\star X\to Y$ be defined as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item the restriction to $Y_{/f}$ is the slice projection $Y_{/f}\to Y$
        \item the restriction to $X$ is $f$
        \item a simplex $\sigma\colon\Delta^n\to Y_{/f}\star X$ not covered by the above cases factors uniquely as $\sigma=\sigma^+\star\sigma^-$ where $\sigma^+\colon\colon\Delta^p\to Y_{/f}$ and $\sigma^-\colon\Delta^q\to X$.
              We can thus identify $\sigma^+\colon\Delta^p\to Y_{/f}$ with a morphism $\overline{f}\colon\Delta^p\star X\to Y$ such that $\overline{f}|_{X}=f$.
              We then set $c(\sigma)=\Delta^n\cong\Delta^p\star\Delta^q\xrightarrow{\id_{\Delta^p}\star\sigma^-}\Delta^p\star X\xrightarrow{\overline{f}} Y$.
    \end{itemize}
    we call $c$ the \emph{slice contraction morphism}.
    The analogous construction $c\colon c\colon X\star Y_{f/}\to Y$ is called the \emph{coslice contraction morphism}.
\end{construction}
\begin{definition} %kerodon Definition 7.3.2.1
    Let $F\colon C\to D$ be a functor between \inftycats/ and let $C_0\subset C$ be a full subcategory.
    Then $F$ is \emph{right Kan-extended from $C_0$} if for all objects $c\in C$ the diagram
    \begin{equation*}
        \left(C_{c/}\times_C C_0\right)^{\lhd}\to \Delta^0\star C_{c/}\xrightarrow{c} C\to D
    \end{equation*}
    where the map $c\colon\Delta^0\star C_{c/}\to C$ is the coslice contraction map, is a limit cone.

    Dually, $F$ is \emph{left Kan-extended from $C_0$} if for all objects $c\in C$ the diagram
    \begin{equation*}
        \left(C_{/c}\times_C C_0\right)^{\rhd}\to C_{/c}\star\Delta^0 \xrightarrow{c} C\to D
    \end{equation*}
    where the map $c\colon C_{/c}\star\Delta^0\to C$ is the slice contraction map, is a colimit cone.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    There is also a notion of Kan-extensions along general functors. 
    We will not need this, but it can be found in e.g. \cite[\S 7.3.1]{kerodon}.
\end{remark}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:exKanExt}
    Let $C$ be an \inftycat/, $C_0\subset C$ a full subcategory and $F\colon C_0\to D$ a functor between \inftycats/.
    If $D$ is complete, then there exists a functor $F\colon C\to D$ that is right Kan-extended from $C_0$.

    Dually if $C$ is cocomplete, then then there exists a functor $F\colon C\to D$ that is left Kan-extended from $C_0$.
    
    Furthermore, in both cases there is a fully faithful functor $\Fun(C_0,D)\to\Fun(C,D)$ that is right/left adjoint to the restriction functor and given by computing right/left Kan-extensions respectively.
    \begin{reference}
        The existence and adjointness for left Kan-extensions is a corollary of \cite[Corollary 7.3.6.4]{kerodon} (and the dual of this proves the statement for right Kan-extensions).
        The fully faithfulness is implied by \cite[Corollary 7.3.1.16]{kerodon} since it is shown that counit/unit of the adjunction is an equivalence.
    \end{reference}
\end{prop}
