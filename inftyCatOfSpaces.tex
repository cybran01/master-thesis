In the following we will describe three model structures that will be very important for the \inftycat/ of spaces: The Quillen modek structure on $\sSet$ (which was already introduced in the previous section), the Quillen model structure on $\Top$ and the \Strom/ model structure on $\Top$.
The first two will turn out the be Quillen equivalent and will be used to define the \inftycat/ of spaces $\spaces$.

The \Strom/ model structure will be important later on; its interaction with the Quillen model structure on $\Top$ will be important parts of our proof that $\spaces$ itself is an \inftytop/.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:sSetCombSimpModelStructure}
    The Quillen model structure on $\sSet$ together with its natural enrichement over itself gives it the structure of a combinatorial simplicial model category.
    \begin{proof}
        First, we see that category $\sSet$ together with the Quillen model structure is a cofibrantly generated model category:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The cofibrations are generated by the class $I=\set{\partial\Delta^n\hookrightarrow \Delta^n\mid n\in\Nat}$
        \item The trivial cofibrations (which are also called \emph{anodyne maps}) are generated by the class $J=\set{\Lambda_k^n\hookrightarrow\Delta^n\mid 0\leq k\leq n}$
    \end{itemize}
    and both of these classes admit the small object argument.
    This is because their domains are finite simplicial sets and therefore their covariant $\hom$-functor commute with filtered colimits.

    The category $\sSet$ is enriched itself by setting $\Hom_{\sSet}(A,B)_n=\hom_{\sSet}(A\times\Delta^n,B)$ to obtain a simplicial category that is tensored (via the product) and powered (via the just defined $\Hom_{\sSet}$).
    By %Kerodon Corollary 1.4.5.6., Theorem 3.1.3.1. Theorem 3.1.3.5. maybe better source
    we have that for a cofibration $A\to B$ and a fibration $X\to Y$ the induced map 
    \begin{equation*}
        \Hom_{\sSet}(B,X)\to\Hom_{\sSet}(A,X)\times_{\Hom_{\sSet}(A,Y)}\Hom_{\sSet}(B,Y)
    \end{equation*}
    is a fibration that additionally is a weak equivalence whenever $A\to B$ or $X\to Y$ is a weak equivalence, so $\sSet$ is a simplicial model category.
    As it is locally presentable by construction and the model structure is cofibrantly generated, we have that $\sSet$ is a combinatorial simplicial model category.
    \end{proof}
\end{prop}
When speaking of cofibrations, fibrations or weak equivalences between topological spaces, we are always referring to this model structure.
\begin{prop}[Quillen Model Structure on $\Top$]
    The following three classes of maps endow $\Top$ with a model structure:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cofibrations are the maps which are retracts of relative CW-complexes. %TODO relative CW-complex def
        \item Weak equivalences are the usual weak equivalences. %TODO DEFINE
        \item Fibrations are the maps with right lifting property against the class of maps $\set{D^n\xhookrightarrow{\left(\id_{D^n},0\right)}D^n\times I\mid n\in\Nat}$.
    \end{itemize}
    We call this model structure the \emph{Quillen Model Structure on $\Top$}.
\end{prop}
\begin{prop}[\Strom/ Model Structure on $\Top$]
    The following three classes of maps endow $\Top$ with a model structure:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cofibrations are the maps which are closed Hurewicz cofibrations. %TODO reference
        \item Weak equivalences are the homotopy equivalences.
        \item Fibrations are the maps with right lifting property against the class of maps $\set{X\xhookrightarrow{\left(\id_{X},0\right)}X\times I\mid X\in\Top}$ (which are also called Hurewicz fibrations).
    \end{itemize}
    We call this model structure the \emph{\Strom/ Model Structure on $\Top$}.
\end{prop}
When referring to the \Strom/ model structure, we will speak of h-cofibrations and h-fibrations, and we will call the weak equivalences homotopy equivalences.
\begin{remark}[Properness]
    The Quillen model structures on $\sSet$ and $\Top$ are both proper (meaning left and right proper).
    The same is true for the \Strom/ model structure, since all objects in this model category are cofibrant and fibrant.
    Hence whenever computing homotopy pushouts/pullbacks, it will suffice to only replace one map by a cofibration/fibration.
\end{remark}
\begin{prop}[Quillen Equivalence of the Quillen Model Structures on $\Top$ and $\sSet$]
    The functors
    \begin{equation*}
        \lvert-\rvert\colon\sSet\rightleftarrows\Top\mkern+3mu:\mkern-3mu\Sing(-)
    \end{equation*}
    form a Quillen equivalence, where $\lvert-\rvert$ denotes geometric realization and $\Sing(-)$ is the singular simplicial set functor.
    \begin{proof}
        By %Kerodon Corollary 1.1.8.5.
        the functors are adjoint.

        Thus $\lvert-\rvert\colon\sSet\to\Top$ preserves colimits and since $\lvert\partial\Delta^n\rvert\to\lvert\Delta^n\rvert\;\cong\;S^{n-1}\xhookrightarrow{} D^n$, geometric realization preserves cofibrations.
        Since it also preserves weak equivalences by definition, it preserves trivial cofibrations and thus the adjunction is a Quillen adjunction.

        To prove it is a Quillen equivalence, we need to prove that 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item for every cofibrant object $A\in\sSet$ and a fibrant replacement $\lvert A\rvert\xrightarrow{\sim}\widehat{\lvert A\rvert}$ the composition $A\to\Sing(\lvert A\rvert)\to\Sing(\widehat{\lvert A\rvert})$ where $A\to\Sing(\lvert A\rvert)$ is the adjuntion unit, is a weak equivalence.
            \item for every fibrant object $X\in\Top$ and a cofibrant replacement $\widehat{\Sing(X)}\xrightarrow{\sim}\Sing(X)$ the composition $\lvert\widehat{\Sing(X)}\rvert\to\lvert\Sing(X)\rvert\to X$ where $\lvert\Sing(X)\rvert\to X$ is the adjunction counit, is a weak equivalence.
        \end{itemize}
        Since all simplicial sets are cofibrant and all topological spaces are fibrant, we can pick the replacements to be the identity in both cases.
        Thus the statement is reduced to proving that unit and counit are objectwise weak equivalences. 
        This is proven in %TODO cite Kerodon 3.5.4.1 and 3.5.4.2 
        .
    \end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:homotopyHypothesis}
    The Quillen equivalence 
    \begin{equation*}
        \lvert-\rvert\colon\sSet\rightleftarrows\Top\mkern+3mu:\mkern-3mu\Sing(-)
    \end{equation*}
    induces an equivalence of \inftycats/ 
    \begin{equation*}
        F\coloneqq\N(\lvert-\rvert)\colon \N(\sSet)\lbrack W_{\sSet}^{-1}\rbrack\longleftrightarrow\N(\Top)\lbrack W_{\Top}^{-1}\rbrack\mkern+3mu:\mkern-3mu\N(\Sing(-))\eqqcolon G\;.
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}%TODO remove proof and just cite, ask for source
        Since we have $\N(\lvert W_{\sSet}\rvert)\subset \N(W_{\Top})$ by definition, by the universal property of localization we obtain a localization $F\colon \N(\sSet)\lbrack W_{\sSet}^{-1}\rbrack\to\N(\Top)\lbrack W_{\Top}^{-1}\rbrack$.

        To prove $\N(\Sing(W_{\Top}))\subset\N(W_{\sSet})$ we have to check that for a weak equivalence if topological spaces $X\xrightarrow{\sim} Y$, the induced map $\lvert\Sing(X)\rvert\to \lvert\Sing(Y)\rvert$ is also a weak equivalence.
        This follows from that fact that a map is a weak equivalence if and only if it is an isomorphism in the homotopy category and the fact that the unit of the adjunction is a weak equivalence.
        Thus we also obtain a functor $G\colon\N(\Top)\lbrack W_{\Top}^{-1}\rbrack\to\N(\sSet)\lbrack W_{\sSet}^{-1}\rbrack$.

        Since unit and counit are objectwise weak equivalences, their induced maps $\epsilon\colon\id\to GF$ and $\eta\colon FG\to \id$ are objectwise invertible and thus invertible natural transformations, which proves the proposition. %TODO cite proof
