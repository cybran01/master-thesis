In this section we will give a proof of the classical James Splitting Theorem \cite{james_splitting_original} for general \inftytops/.
The classical James Splitting Theorem in $\spaces$ states that for connected pointed objects $X$, there is a canonical equivalence $\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\to\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X$.
Our main source is \cite[\S 2.2 and \S 4]{splittings_21}.

We begin by introducing some well known constructions that we will need throughout the rest of this section.
\begin{definition}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/.
    Then 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item for an object $X$ in $C$, we call a pushout
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                X \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & * \arrow[d, "i_0"] \\
                * \arrow[r, "i_1"] & \Sigma X \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        a \emph{suspension of $X$}.
        \item for pointed objects $X$ and $Y$ in $C$, we call a pushout
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                * \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & Y \arrow[d] \\
                X \arrow[r] & X\vee Y \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        a \emph{wedge sum of $X$ and $Y$}.
        \item for pointed objects $X$ and $Y$ in $C$, we call a pushout
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                X\vee Y \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & X\times Y \arrow[d] \\
                * \arrow[r] & X\wedge Y \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        a \emph{smash product of $X$ and $Y$} (where the map $X\vee Y\to X\times Y$ is a canonical map from the universal property induced by the maps $X\vee Y\to X$ and $X\vee Y\to Y$).
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{The Fundamental James Splitting}
As a first step, we will show that there is a canonical equivalence $\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X\cong\Sigma X\vee\left(X\wedge\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X\right)$ for an arbitrary pointed object $X$.
This is called the \emph{Fundamental James Splitting}.

The next lemma is a key ingredient of the proof of the Fundamental James Splitting.
There is some subtlety involved in it, see \cref{rmk:mapNotProj}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:existenceOfPoSq}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let $X\in \left(C_*\right)_0$ be a pointed object.
    Then there exists a pushout square  
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
            X\times\Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r, "\pi_2"] \arrow[d, "\alpha"] & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[d] \\
            \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r] & * \\
        \end{tikzcd}\;.
    \end{center}
    \begin{proof}
        The definition of $\Sigma X$
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                X \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & * \arrow[d, "i_0"] \\
                * \arrow[r, "i_1"] & \Sigma X \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        shows that $i_0$ and $i_1$ are equivalent maps in $C$ (meaning identical in $\ho(C)$), since $X\to *\xrightarrow{i_0}\Sigma X$ and $X\to *\xrightarrow{i_1}\Sigma X$ are identical in $\ho(C)$ by construction and the canonical point $x\colon*\to X$ is a right inverse to $X\to *$.
        Thus we get that the squares
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & * \arrow[d, "i_0"] \\
                * \arrow[r, "i_0"] & \Sigma X \\
            \end{tikzcd}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & * \arrow[d, "i_0"] \\
                * \arrow[r, "i_1"] & \Sigma X \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        are pullback squares.
        Now we pick a product together with projections to obtain a pullback square 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                X\times\Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r, "\pi_2"] \arrow[d, "\pi_1"] & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[d] \\
                X \arrow[r] & * \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        and assemble these pullback squares into a diagram
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = .5 cm]
                X\times\Omega\Sigma X \arrow [rr, "\pi_2"] \arrow [dd, "\pi_1"] & & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow [dr] \arrow[dd] \\
                & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow [rr, crossing over] & & * \arrow [dd, "i_0"] & \\
                X \arrow [dr] \arrow [rr] & & * \arrow [dr, "i_0"] \\
                & * \arrow [from=uu,crossing over] \arrow [rr, "i_1"] & & \Sigma X &
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        where the three vertical squares are pullback, and the bottom square is a pushout.

        Now let $\Fun(\Delta^1\times\Delta^1,C)_{pb}\subset\Fun(\Delta^1\times\Delta^1,C)$ denote the full subcategory of pullback squares.
        Then the functor $\lim\colon\Fun(\Lambda_0^2,C)\to\Fun(\Delta^1\times\Delta^1,C)_{pb}$ is an equivalence of \inftycats/ since it is essentially surjective by definition and fully faithful since it is a right Kan-extension along the inclusion $\Lambda_0^2\subset\Delta^1\times\Delta^1$.

        The previous diagram gives a natural transformation $\alpha\in\Fun(\Lambda_2^2,C)_1$ where $\alpha_0$ and $\alpha_1 $ are the restrictions of the back square and the front square to $\Lambda_2^2$ respectively.
        The induced natural transformation $\overline{\alpha}=\lim(\alpha)$ is a map between pullback squares, and since back and front square in the above diagram were already pullbacks, they are equivalent to $\overline{\alpha}_0$ and $\overline{\alpha}_1$ respectively.
        The map $\overline{\alpha}$ together with the equivalences of pullback squares thus induces a cube
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = .5 cm]
                X\times\Omega\Sigma X \arrow [dr, "\alpha"] \arrow [rr, "\pi_2"] \arrow [dd, "\pi_1"] & & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow [dr] \arrow[dd] \\
                & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow [rr, crossing over] & &[1em] * \arrow [dd, "i_0"] & \\
                X \arrow [dr] \arrow [rr] & & * \arrow [dr, "i_0"] \\
                & * \arrow [from=uu, crossing over] \arrow [rr, "i_1"] & & \Sigma X &
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        and we claim that the left face is also a pullback:

        The outer square of the diagram
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                X\times\Omega\Sigma X \arrow[d, "\pi_1"] \arrow[r, "\pi_2"] & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & * \arrow[d, "i_0"] \\
                X \arrow[r] & * \arrow[r, "i_0"] & \Sigma X \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        is a pullback since both squares are pullbacks by assumption.
        Furthermore, the outer square of this diagram is equivalent to the outer square of the diagram
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                X\times\Omega\Sigma X \arrow[d, "\pi_1"] \arrow[r, "\alpha"] & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & * \arrow[d, "i_0"] \\
                X \arrow[r] & * \arrow[r, "i_1"] & \Sigma X \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        which shows that it is also a pullback.
        Since the right square in this diagram is a pullback by assumption, the pasting law for pullbacks implies that the left square is also a pullback.

        Thus all vertical squares of the cube
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = .5 cm]
                X\times\Omega\Sigma X \arrow [dr, "\alpha"] \arrow [rr, "\pi_2"] \arrow [dd, "\pi_1"'] & & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow [dr] \arrow[dd] \\
                & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow [rr, crossing over] & &[1em] * \arrow [dd, "i_0"] & \\
                X \arrow [dr] \arrow [rr] & & * \arrow [dr, "i_0"] \\
                & * \arrow [from=uu, crossing over] \arrow [rr, "i_1"] & & \Sigma X &
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        are pullbacks and since the bottom square is a pushout by assumption, hence by universality the top square is pushout which finishes the proof.
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
\begin{remark}\label{rmk:mapNotProj}
    The map $\alpha\colon X\times\Omega\Sigma X\to\Omega\Sigma X$ can in general not be identified with the projection $\pi_2$.
    We are not able to choose the map $\alpha$ freely since the higher simplices must be compatible along the ``diagonal'' of our cube (which our map $\alpha$ fulfills by construction, since it is a universal map).

    If we assume $\alpha=\pi_2$ then by universality we have that 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
            X\times \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r,"\pi_2"] \arrow[d, "\pi_2"] & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[d] \\
            \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r] & \Sigma X \times \Omega\Sigma X\\
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    is a pushout.
    But $\Omega\Sigma X\times \Sigma X$ is not generally contractible. 
\end{remark}
\begin{corollary}\label{lem:poOfProductIsSuspension}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let $X\in \left(C_*\right)_0$ be a pointed object. 
    Then there exists a square
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
            X\times\Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r, "\pi_2"] \arrow[d] & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[d] \\
            * \arrow[r] & \Sigma\Omega\Sigma X \\
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    that is a pushout.
    \begin{proof}
        This follows from \cref{lem:existenceOfPoSq} and the pasting lemma applied to 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                X\times\Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r, "\pi_2"] \arrow[d, "\alpha"] & \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[d] \\
                \Omega\Sigma X \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & * \arrow[d] \\
                * \arrow[r] & \Sigma\Omega\Sigma X \\
            \end{tikzcd}\;.
        \end{center}
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}
We will also need to prove some basic facts about wedges and smash products.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:poOfCollapseMapsIsTrivial}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let $X,Y$ be pointed objects in $C$. 
    Then 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
            X\vee Y \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & Y \arrow[d] \\
            X \arrow[r] & * \\
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    is a pushout.
    \begin{proof}
        We want to show that the square $\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{4}}$ in the diagram
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                * \arrow[r] \arrow[d] \ar[dr,phantom,"\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{1}}"] & Y \arrow[r] \arrow[d] \ar[dr,phantom,"\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{2}}"] & * \arrow[d] \\
                X \arrow[r] \arrow[d] \ar[dr,phantom,"\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{3}}"] & X\vee Y \arrow[r] \arrow[d] \ar[dr,phantom,"\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{4}}"] & X \arrow[d]\\
                * \arrow[r] & Y \arrow[r] & * \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        is a pushout.
        Since $\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{1}}$ and the composite square $\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{1}}+\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{2}}$ are pushouts, $\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{2}}$ is a pushout by the pasting law.
        But since $\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{2}}$ and the composite square $\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{2}}+\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{4}}$ are pushouts, by the pasting law we have that $\textcircled{\raisebox{-0.9pt}{4}}$ is a pushout.
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:poSqWithFactoringTerminal}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let $X,Y$ be pointed objects in $C$. 
    Then there is a pushout square
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
            X\times Y \arrow[r, "\pi_2"] \arrow[d, "\pi_1"'] & Y \arrow[d] \\
            X \arrow[r] & \Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right) \\
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    such that the unlabeled morphisms factor through the terminal object.
    \begin{proof}
        Because colimits commute, the colimit of the diagram 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                * & * \arrow[l] \arrow[r] & * \\
                X \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[u] & X\vee Y \arrow[l]  \arrow[r] \arrow[d] \arrow[u] & Y \arrow[d, equal] \arrow[u] \\
                X  & X\times Y \arrow[l] \arrow[r] & Y \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        indexed by $\Lambda_0^2\times\Lambda_0^2$ can be computed by either taking pushouts of the rows and then the pushout of the resulting $\Lambda_0^2$-shaped diagram, or taking pushouts of the columns and then taking pushout of the resulting $\Lambda_0^2$-shaped diagram.
        
        Taking pushouts of the rows results in the diagram $*\xleftarrow{}*\rightarrow X\cup_{X\times Y} Y$ where we use \cref{lem:poOfCollapseMapsIsTrivial} and taking pushouts of the columns results in the diagram $*\xleftarrow{}X\wedge Y\rightarrow *$. 
        Since the pushout of the latter diagram is $\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right)$ and the pushout of the first diagram must be equivalent to this, we have $X\cup_{X\times Y} Y\simeq\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right)$.
        
        It remains to show that the maps $X\to\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right)$ and $Y\to\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right)$ factor through $*$.
        But this follows directly from the starting diagram since the colimit cone $\left(\Lambda_0^2\times\Lambda_0^2\right)^{\rhd}\to C$ has $2$-simplices of the form
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd}[sep = 3em]
                & \Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right) & \\
                X \ar[rr] \ar[ur]& & * \ar[ul]
            \end{tikzcd}
            \begin{tikzcd}[sep = 3em]
                & \Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right) & \\
                Y \ar[rr] \ar[ur]& & * \ar[ul]
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:allSqArePo}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let $X,Y$ be pointed objects in $C$. 
    Then all squares of the diagram         
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
            X\times Y \arrow[r, "\pi_2"] \arrow[d, "\pi_1"'] & Y \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & * \arrow[d] \\
            X \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & \Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right) \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & \Sigma Y\vee\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right) \arrow[d]\\
            * \arrow[r] &  \Sigma X\vee\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right)\arrow[r] & \Sigma X\vee\Sigma Y\vee\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right) \\
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    are pushouts.
    \begin{proof}
        By \cref{lem:poSqWithFactoringTerminal} the top left square is a pushout square.
        The top right square is a pushout by the pasting law applied to
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                Y \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & * \arrow[d] \\
                * \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & \Sigma Y \arrow[d] \\
                \Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right) \arrow[r] & \Sigma Y\vee\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right) \\
            \end{tikzcd}\
        \end{center}
        because $Y\to\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right)$ factors through $*$ (again by \cref{lem:poSqWithFactoringTerminal}).
        The analogous argument also shows that the bottom left square is a pushout.

        The bottom right square is a pushout since for pointed objects $A,B,C\in \left(C_*\right)_0$ the square
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                B \arrow[r] \arrow[d] &  B\vee C \arrow[d] \\
                A\vee B \arrow[r] & A\vee B\vee C\\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        is a pushout because colimits commuate and the wedge sum is commutative.
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
The following corollary is not needed for our proof, however it is useful and immediate from what we have already shown.
\begin{corollary}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let $X,Y$ be pointed objects in $C$. 
    Then we have $\Sigma\left(X\times Y\right)\cong\Sigma X\vee\Sigma Y\vee\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right)$.
    \begin{proof}
        The outer square of \cref{lem:allSqArePo} proves this immediately. 
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:suspensionCommutesWithSmash}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let $X,Y$ be pointed objects in $C$. 
    Then there is a canonical equivalence $\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right)\cong X\wedge\Sigma Y$.
    \begin{proof}
        Let $i_0,i_1\colon *\to\Sigma Y$ be the canonical maps from the definition $\Sigma Y$ as a pushout.
        These induce maps $j_0,j_1\colon X \to X\vee\Sigma Y$ and $k_0,k_1\colon X\to X\times\Sigma Y$.
        The squares
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                X\vee Y \arrow[r] \arrow[d] &  X \arrow[d, "j_0"] \\
                X \arrow[r, "j_1"] & X\vee\Sigma Y\\
            \end{tikzcd}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                X\times Y \arrow[r] \arrow[d] &  X \arrow[d, "k_0"] \\
                X \arrow[r, "k_1"] & X\times\Sigma Y\\
            \end{tikzcd}\
        \end{center}
        are both pushouts; the first one as colimits commute and the second one due to universality applied to the cube
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = .5 cm]
                X\times Y \arrow [dr] \arrow [rr] \arrow [dd] & & X \arrow [dr, "k_1"] \arrow[dd] \\
                & X \arrow [rr, crossing over, near start, "k_0"] & &  X\times\Sigma Y \arrow [dd] & \\
                Y \arrow [dr] \arrow [rr] & & * \arrow [dr, "i_1"] \\
                & * \arrow [from=uu, crossing over] \arrow [rr, "i_0"] & &\Sigma Y &
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        where
        \begin{itemize}

        as in \cref{lem:poSqWithFactoringTerminal} we get $X\wedge\Sigma Y$ by computing the pushout of the pushouts of the rows and $\Sigma\left(X\wedge Y\right)$ by computing the pushout of the pushouts of the columns, which proves the proposition.

\begin{corollary}[Fundamental James Splitting]\label{cor:fundamentalJamesSplitting}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let $X$ be a pointed object in $C$. 
    Then there exists a canonical equivalence $\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X\simeq\Sigma X\vee\left(X\wedge\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X\right)$.
    \begin{proof}
        Applying \cref{lem:allSqArePo} to $X$ and $Y=\Omega\Sigma X$, the left vertical and top horizontal maps of the big left square (top and bottom left squares combined) are equivalent to the maps of the square in \cref{lem:poOfProductIsSuspension}.
        Since both are pushout squares, we get an equivalence $\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X\simeq\Sigma X\vee\Sigma\left(X\wedge\Omega\Sigma X\right)$ and the proposition follows from \cref{lem:suspensionCommutesWithSmash}.

\subsection*{The James Splitting Theorem in $\Fun(A,\spaces)$}
We will now prove the James Splitting Theorem for general \inftytops/.
By \cref{rem:genTopoiComparisonMapEq} we will see that it suffices to prove this for \inftytops/ of the form $\Fun(A,\spaces)$ where $A$ is a small \inftycat/ by a localization argument.

We will however work in the setting of general \inftytops/ whenever possible; 
in fact, only the very last step will require us to restrict to $C=\Fun(A,\spaces)$ since we need our \inftytop/ to be hypercomplete, which is not true generally.
\begin{corollary}[Fundamental James Splitting, iterated] %TODO prove assoc and dist of wedge 
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let $X$ be a pointed object in $C$. 
    Then for all $n\geq 1$ there is a canonical equivalence
    \begin{equation*}
        \bigvee\limits_{i=1}^n\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\vee\left(X^{\wedge n}\wedge\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X\right)\simeq\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X 
    \end{equation*}
    induced by \cref{cor:fundamentalJamesSplitting} such that the diagram
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd}
            \bigvee\limits_{i=1}^n\Sigma X^{\wedge i} \ar[r] \ar[dd, hook] & \bigvee\limits_{i=1}^n\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\vee\left(X^{\wedge n}\wedge\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X\right) \ar[dr,"\simeq"]\\

        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    commutes.
    Here $\Sigma X^{\wedge i}$ denotes $\Sigma\left(X\wedge X\wedge\ldots\wedge X\right)$ with $X$ appearing $i$ times.
    \begin{proof}
        This follows inductively from \cref{cor:fundamentalJamesSplitting} and \cref{lem:suspensionCommutesWithSmash}.
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}
\begin{definition}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let $X$ be a pointed object in $C$. 
    Then the canonical maps 
    \begin{equation*}
        c_X^n\colon\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^n\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\to\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^n\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\vee\left(X^{\wedge n}\wedge\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X\right)\xrightarrow{\simeq}\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X
    \end{equation*}
    from the previous corollary induce a map
    \begin{equation*}
        c_X\colon\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\to\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X
    \end{equation*}
    which we refer to as the \emph{comparison map}.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}\label{def:connected}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/.
    With the convention that every map is $(-2)$-connected, we recursively define that a map $f\colon X\to Y$ in $C$ is \emph{$k$-connected} for $k\geq -1$ if
    \begin{itemize}
        \item it is an effective epimorphism
        \item the diagonal map $X\to X\times_YX$ is $(k-1)$-connected.
    \end{itemize} 
    If $f$ is connected for all $k\in\Nat$, then we say that $f$ is \emph{$\infty$-connected}.
    We consider an object $X$ to be \emph{$k$-connected} if the map $X\to *$ is $k$-connected.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    There is ``another'' definition of connectedness in $\Top$:

    A space $X$ in $\Top$ is 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \emph{topologically $(-1)$-connected} if $X\neq\emptyset$
        \item \emph{topologically $n$-connected} for $n\in\Nat$ if $X\neq\emptyset$ and for all $x\in X$ and $k\leq n$, we have $\pi_k(X,x)\cong 0$
    \end{itemize}
    with the convention that all spaces are \emph{topologically $(-2)$-connected}.
    A map $f\colon X\to Y$ in $\Top$ is \emph{topologically $n$-conneced} for $n\in\Nat\cup\set{-2,-1}$ if all its homotopy fibers are $n$-connected. 
    %(For authors this definition means a topologically $(n+1)$-conneced map.) %TODO maybe mention that some authors use different definition; for them, this map is (n+1)-connected

    This definition agrees with the definition of connectedness in $\spaces$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For $n=-2$ there is nothing to prove.
        \item For $n\geq -1$ all homotopy fibers of $f$ are nonempty, hence $f$ is an effective epimorphism (see \cref{prop:effInSpaceIffSurj}).
            Furthermore, given the pullback square
            \begin{center}
                \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                    X\times_{Y} X \arrow[r, "g"] \arrow[d, "g"] & X \arrow[d, "f"] \\
                    X \arrow[r, "f"] & Y \\
                \end{tikzcd}
            \end{center}
            in $\spaces$, we claim the map $g$ is topologically $n$-connected if and only if $f$ is topologically $n$-connected:
            
            From the fiberwise characterization of homotopy pullbacks, it follows directly that if $f$ is topologically $n$-connected, $g$ is as well.%TODO cref fiberwise char

            Since homotopy fibers are essentially constant on path-connected components and $f$ is an effective epimorphism, the fiberwise characterization of homotopy pullbacks also shows that $f$ is topologically $n$-connected if $g$ is topologically $n$-connected.

            Furthermore, the universal map $s\colon X\to X\times_{Y} X$ is a section of $g$ in $\spaces$.
            By inspection of the long exact sequences of homotopy groups, $g$ is topologically $n$-connected if and only if the section $s$ is topologically $(n-1)$-connected.

            This allows us to recursively reduce to the case of $f\colon X\to Y$ being topologically $(-2)$-connected, in which we have already seen that both definitions coincide.
    \end{itemize}
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
    We say that an \inftytop/ $C$ is \emph{hypercomplete} if every $\infty$-connected map is an equivalence.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    Every equivalence is $\infty$-connected, however the converse is not true for general \inftytops/.
    For every small \inftycat/ $A$, $\Fun(A,\spaces)$ is an \inftytop/ that is hypercomplete.
    This can be seen using \cite[Remark 6.5.4.7]{HTT}.
\end{remark}
Our goal now is to prove that the comparison map is an equivalence whenever $X$ is a $0$-connected pointed object.
We will prove this only in $\Fun(A,\spaces)$, however this case is already enough to derive the result for general topoi (see \cref{rem:genTopoiComparisonMapEq}).

The main idea is to show that $X^{\wedge n}\wedge\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X$ becomes increasingly connected and vanishes as $n\to\infty$.
For this proof we need some stability properties of connectedness.
\begin{prop}\label{prop:conn}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and $k\geq -2$.
    Then
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item $k$-connected morphisms are stable under pushout. \label{prop:connStableUnderPo}
        \item $k$-connected morphisms are stable under pullback.\label{prop:connStableUnderPb}
        \item for morphisms $f\colon X\to Y$ and $g\colon Y\to Z$ with $f$ $k$-connected, the morphism $g$ is $k$-connected if and only if $gf$ is $k$-connected. \label{prop:connRightCancel}
        \item for a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ with a section $s\colon Y\to X$, $f$ is $(k+1)$-connected if and only if $s$ is $k$-connected. \label{prop:connSection}
        \item the class of $k$-connected objects is stable under filtered colimits. \label{prop:connStableFilteredColim}
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{reference}
        \cite[Proposition 4.10]{splittings_21}
    \end{reference}
\end{prop}
\begin{thm}[Blakers-Massey Theorem]\label{prop:blakersMassey}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/ and let 
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
            A \arrow[r, "g"] \arrow[d, "f"] &  C \arrow[d] \\
            B \arrow[r] & D \\
        \end{tikzcd}
    \end{center}
    be a pushout square in $C$.
    Then if $f$ is $n$-connected and $g$ is $m$-connected, the canonical map $A\to B\times_{D}C$ is $(n+m)$-connected.
    \begin{reference}
        A very general version for \inftytops/ can be found in \cite[Corollary 4.3.1]{gen_blakers_massey}, but the version used here can also be proven by a reduction to topoi of the form $\Fun(A,\spaces)$ similar to \cref{rem:genTopoiComparisonMapEq} and thus derived from the ordinary Blakers-Massey Theorem in $\Top$.
    \end{reference}
\end{thm}
With these we can deduce the following statements:
\begin{corollary}\label{cor:connEst}
    Let $C$ be an \inftytop/, $X,Y$ pointed objects in $C$ and $k,l\geq 0$. 
    If $X$ is $k$-connected and $Y$ is $l$-connected, then
    \begin{enumerate}[label={(\roman*)}]
        \item the suspension $\Sigma X$ is $(k+1)$-connected. \label{cor:connEstSuspension}
        \item the canonical map $X\to X\vee Y$ is $(l-1)$-connected. \label{cor:connEstVeeIncl}
        \item the smash product $X\wedge Y$ is $(k + l + 1)$-connected. \label{cor:connEstSmash}
        \item for every $n\geq 0$, the smash product $X^{\wedge n}$ is $(n(k+1)-1)$-connected. \label{cor:connEstIteratedSmash}
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{proof}
        \ref{cor:connEstSuspension}: Since $X$ is $k$-connected by \cref{prop:conn} \ref{prop:connStableUnderPo} the pushout of the map $X\to *$ which is a map $*\to \Sigma X$ is $k$-connected.
        Thus by \cref{prop:conn} \ref{prop:connSection} the map $\Sigma X\to *$ is $(k+1)$-connected.

        \ref{cor:connEstVeeIncl}: Since the map $*\to Y$ is $(l-1)$-connected by \cref{prop:conn} \ref{prop:connSection}, by \cref{prop:conn} \ref{prop:connStableUnderPo} the map $X\to X\vee Y$ is also $(l-1)$-connected.
        
        \ref{cor:connEstSmash}: By \cref{prop:blakersMassey} and \cref{lem:poOfCollapseMapsIsTrivial} we have that $X\vee Y\to X\times Y$ is  $(k+l)$-connected. 
        By \cref{prop:conn} \ref{prop:connStableUnderPo} the map $*\to X\wedge Y$ is thus also $(k+l)$-connected and so by \cref{prop:conn} \ref{prop:connSection} the space $X\wedge Y$ is $(k+l+1)$-connected.

        \ref{cor:connEstIteratedSmash}: This follows by induction on \ref{cor:connEstSmash}.
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}
\begin{prop}[James Splitting for Presheaf Categories]\label{prop:jamesSplittingPresheaf} %ref Proposition 4.18 
    Let $A$ be a small \inftycat/ and let $X$ be a pointed and $0$-connected object in the \inftytop/ $\Fun(A,\spaces)$.
    Then the comparison morphism 
    \begin{equation*}
        c_X\colon\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\to\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X
    \end{equation*}
    is an equivalence. 
    \begin{proof}
        Since $\Fun(A,\spaces)$ is hypercomplete it suffices to prove that $c_X$ is $\infty$-connected.

        First for each $n\in\Nat_{\geq 1}$ we have $2$-simplices in $\Fun(A,\spaces)$
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = 4em]
                \bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{n}\Sigma X^{\wedge i} \arrow[r] \arrow[dr] & \bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\Sigma X^{\wedge i} \arrow[d, "c_X"] \\
                & \Sigma\Omega\Sigma X \\
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        induced by the universal property of $\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\Sigma X^{\wedge i}$.

        By \cref{cor:connEst} \ref{cor:connEstIteratedSmash} $X^{\wedge n}$ is $(n-1)$-connected.
        By \cref{prop:conn} \ref{prop:connStableUnderPo} and \cref{prop:conn} \ref{prop:connStableUnderPb} we have that $\Omega\Sigma X$ is $0$-connected, so by \cref{cor:connEst} \ref{cor:connEstSuspension} $\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X$ is $1$-connected and combining this via \cref{cor:connEst} \ref{cor:connEstSmash} shows that $X^{\wedge n}\wedge\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X$ is $(n+1)$-connected.

        So the map 
        \begin{equation*}
            c_X^n\colon\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^n\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\to\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^n\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\vee\left(X^{\wedge n}\wedge\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X\right)\xrightarrow{\cong}\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X
        \end{equation*}
        corresponding to the diagonal map of the above triangle is $n$-connected by \cref{cor:connEst} \ref{cor:connEstVeeIncl}.

        Since by \cref{cor:connEst} \ref{cor:connEstIteratedSmash} and \cref{cor:connEst} \ref{cor:connEstSmash} every object of the filtered colimit $\bigvee\limits_{i=n+1}^{\infty}\Sigma X^{\wedge i}$ is at least $(n+1)$-connected, by \cref{prop:conn} \ref{prop:connStableFilteredColim} it is itself $(n+1)$-connected.
        So by \cref{cor:connEst} \ref{cor:connEstVeeIncl} we have that the horizontal map of the triangle $\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^n\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\to\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^n\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\vee\bigvee\limits_{i=n+1}^{\infty}\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\cong\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\Sigma X^{\wedge i}$ is $n$-connected.

        As the diagonal as well as the horizontal map of the triangle above are $n$-connected, from \cref{prop:conn} \ref{prop:connRightCancel} it follows that $c_X$ is $n$-connected. 
        As $n$ was arbitrary, $c_X$ is therefore an equivalence.

\begin{corollary}[Classical James Splitting]\label{cor:classicalJamesSplitting}
    Let $X$ be a pointed and $0$-connected object in $\spaces$.
    Then     
    \begin{equation*}
        c_X\colon\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\Sigma X^{\wedge i}\to\Sigma\Omega\Sigma X
    \end{equation*}
    is an equivalence.

        This is \cref{prop:jamesSplittingPresheaf} with $A=\Delta^0$.
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}
\begin{remark}\label{rem:genTopoiComparisonMapEq}
    Due to the equivalent characterizations of \inftytops/ in \cite[Definition 6.1.0.6]{HTT} for every \inftytop/ $C$ there exists a small \inftycat/ $A$ and a map $f\colon\Fun(A,\spaces)\to C$ that preserves finite limits and has a fully faithful right adjoint $i$.
    
    Then if for a pointed object $X$ in $C$ the comparison morphism $c_{i(X)}$ is an equivalence in $Fun(A,\spaces)$, so is $c_X$ in $C$ (see \cite[Lemma 4.17]{splittings_21}).
    If $X$ is $0$-connected then so is $i(X)$, so it suffices to prove that it $c_{i(X)}$ is $\infty$-connected since $\Fun(A,\spaces)$ is hypercomplete. 
    But we have proven this in \cref{prop:jamesSplittingPresheaf}, so it is true for all \inftytops/.
\end{remark}
Lastly, we give an application of the James Splitting Theorem.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:reducedHomLoopOfSpheres}
    Let $H_*$ be a reduced homology theory and let $S^n$ with $n\geq1$ be a model of the pointed $n$-sphere.
    Then
    \begin{equation*}
        H_k(\Omega S^{n+1})\cong\bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}H_k(S^{ni})\;.
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        Note that for $n>0$ the sphere is $0$-connected.
        Thus by \cref{cor:classicalJamesSplitting} we have an isomorphism 
        \begin{equation*}
            H_{k+1}\left(\bigvee\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}\Sigma \left(S^n\right)^{\wedge i}\right)\cong H_{k+1}\left(\Sigma\Omega\Sigma S^n\right)\;.
        \end{equation*}
        This gives an isomorphism
        \begin{equation*}
            \bigoplus\limits_{i=1}^{\infty}H_k\left(\left(S^n\right)^{\wedge i}\right)\cong H_k\left(\Omega S^{n+1}\right)
        \end{equation*}
        and the fact that $S^{n_1}\wedge S^{n_2}\cong S^{n_1+n_2}$ proves the claim.
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
\begin{corollary}
    For $H_*$ reduced ordinary homology and $S^n$ with $n\geq1$ a model of the pointed $n$-sphere, we have
    \begin{equation*}
        H_k(\Omega S^{n+1})\cong
        \begin{cases}
            \mathbb{Z} & k=ni ~for~ i\in\Nat\\
            0 & otherwise
        \end{cases}\;.
    \end{equation*}
    \begin{proof}
        This follows from \cref{lem:reducedHomLoopOfSpheres} and the reduced ordinary homology of the spheres.
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}
