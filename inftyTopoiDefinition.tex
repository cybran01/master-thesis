Before giving a proper definition of \inftytops/, we need to introduce another property.
Since this we be the least interesting for our purposes, we will give a very pragmatic introduction.
\begin{definition}
    An \inftycat/ $C$ is \emph{locally presentable} if there exists a combinatorial simplicial model category $A$ and an equivalence of \inftycats/ $\Nhc(A^°)\to C$.
\end{definition}
\begin{corollary}
    A presentably \inftycat/ $C$ has small colimits and small limits.
    \begin{proof}
        These are computed in some combinatorial simplicial model category $A$ where they exist.
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}
    The \inftycat/ of spaces $\spaces$ is locally presentable.
    \begin{proof}
        This follows directly by \cref{prop:homotopyHypothesis} and \cref{cor:htpyCoherentNerveIsLoc}.
    \end{proof}
\end{corollary}
An overview for some equivalent characterizations for an \inftycat/ to be locally presentable can be found in %HTT 5.5.1.1, A.3.7.6
.

In essence, being locally presentable means being determined by a ''small'' amount of data, despite the category in question not needing to be small itself.
% To be more precise: By %TODO HTT 5.5.1.1 (4)
% an \inftycat/ $C$ is locally presentable if and only if there exists a regular cardinal $\kappa$ and an \inftycat/ $D$ with $\kappa$-small colimits such that there is an equivalence of \inftycats/ $\Ind_{\kappa}D\to C$.

% Here $\Ind_{\kappa}D$ is the full subcategory of $\Fun(D^{\op},S)$ with objects consisting of those maps $C^{\op}\to\spaces$ that classify right fibrations $X\to C$ such that $X$ is $\kappa$-filtered (see e.g. %HTT Definition 5.3.5.1
% for details on this).

% One can show that this effectively means that $C$ is the \inftycat/ obtained by freely adjoining filtered colimits to $D$. %TODO HTT §5.3.5 

Next we introduce cartesian transformations which allow us to encode universality and descent in a concise manner.
\begin{definition}[Cartesian Transformation]
    Let $C$ be an \inftycat/ and let $K$ be a simplicial set.
    Let $q,p\in\Fun(K,C)_0$ and let $\alpha\in\Fun(K,C)_1$ be a natural transformation $\alpha\colon p\to q$.
    Then we say $\alpha$ is \emph{cartesian} if for all maps $u\colon\Delta^1\to K$ the induced map $\Delta^1\times\Delta^1\xrightarrow{\left(u,\id_{\Delta^1}\right)}K\times\Delta^1\xrightarrow{\alpha}C$ is a pullback square. %TODO add comm sq
\end{definition}
%TODO HTT Proposition 4.4.2.6.
\begin{definition}[Universality]
    Let $C$ be an \inftycat/ that admits small colimits and pullbacks and let $K$ be a simplicial set.
    We say that \emph{$C$ has $K$-shaped universal colimits} if for all natural transformations $\alpha\colon p\to q\in\Fun(K^{\rhd},C)_1$ such that $q$ is a colimit cone and $\alpha$ is cartesian, $p$ is a colimit cone.
    We say that \emph{$C$ has universal colimits} if $C$ has $K$-shaped universal colimits for every small simplicial set $K$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Descent]
    Let $C$ be an \inftycat/ that admits small colimits and pullbacks.
    We say that \emph{$C$ has $K$-shaped descent} if for all natural transformations $\alpha\colon p\to q\in\Fun(K^{\rhd},C)_1$ such that $p,q$ are colimit cones and $\alpha|_K$ is cartesian, $\alpha$ is cartesian.
    We say that \emph{$C$ has desent} if $C$ has $K$-shaped descent for every small simplicial set $K$.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
    We want to describe universality and descent explicitly for pushouts ($\Lambda^2_0$-shaped diagrams), because these will be important cases as the next two lemmas will show.
    A natural transformation $\alpha\colon\left(\Lambda_0^2\right)^{\rhd}\times\Delta^1\cong\Delta^1\times\Delta^1\times\Delta^1\to C$ is a cube
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzcd} [sep = .5 cm]
            \alpha|_{\set{0,0,0}} \arrow [dr] \arrow [rr] \arrow [dd] & & \alpha|_{\set{0,1,0}} \arrow [dr] \arrow [dd] \\
            & \alpha|_{\set{1,0,0}} \arrow [rr, crossing over] \arrow [dd] & & \alpha|_{\set{1,1,0}} \arrow [dd] & \\
            \alpha|_{\set{0,0,1}} \arrow [dr] \arrow [rr] & & \alpha|_{\set{0,1,1}} \arrow [dr] \\
            & \alpha|_{\set{1,0,1}} \arrow [from=uu, crossing over] \arrow [rr] & & \alpha|_{\set{1,1,1}} &
        \end{tikzcd}\;.
    \end{center}
    Universality for pushouts means that whenever the vertical faces are pullbacks and the bottom face is a pushout, then the top face is a pushout.
    Descent for pushouts means that whenever left and rear face are pullbacks and top and bottom faces are pushouts, then the right and front face are pullbacks as well.
    
    So this definition is exactly the one given in \cref{sec:motivationInftyTopoi}.
\end{remark}
In order to prove that a given \inftycat/ has universality and descent we only need to check it for two types of diagrams: pushouts and small coproducts.
This is the content of the next two lemmas and will be used later to prove that $\spaces$ is an \inftytop/.
\begin{lemma}
    A \inftycat/ $C$ has universal colimits if and only if it has universal pushouts and universal coproducts.
    \begin{proof}
        Let $\alpha\colon p\to q\in\Fun(K^{\rhd},C)_1$ be a cartesian transformation and let $q$ be a colimit cone. 
        We prove the statement first for all finite dimensional $K$ by induction over the dimension of $K$.

        For $\dim K=-1$ the statement is clear since $K$ is empty.
        
        Let $\dim K=n+1$. 
        Then by the skeletal filtration, $K=K^{n+1}=K^n\bigcup\limits_{\cup_S \partial\Delta^{n+1}}\cup_S \Delta^{n+1}$ where $S$ is the set of non-degenerate simplicies of dimension $n+1$.
        For ease of notation, we set $X_{0}=\cup_S \partial\Delta^{n+1}$, $X_1=K^n$ and $X_2=\cup_S \Delta^{n+1}$.

        Let $p_i,q_i\colon X_i^{\rhd}\to C$ be the maps obtained by precomposing $p$ or $q$ with the respective map to $K$ from the skeletal filtration and taking the conepoint of $q_i$ to be the colimit, and the conepoint of $p_i$ to be the pullback
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
                {
                  p_i(\infty) & q(\infty)\\
                  q_i(\infty) & p(\infty)\\};
                \path[-stealth]
    
                (m-1-1) edge (m-1-2)
                (m-1-1) edge (m-2-1)
                (m-2-1) edge (m-2-2)
                (m-1-2) edge (m-2-2);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        Then $\alpha$ induces maps $\alpha_i\colon p_i\to q_i$ which are cartesian.

        By the induction hypothesis we thus have that $p_0$ and $p_1$ are colimit cones.

        Since $\Delta^{n+1}$ has a terminal object, colimits over $\Delta^{n+1}$ can be computed by evalutaing the terminal object.
        In particular it is given by evaluation of some element $x\in K_0$.

        Thus we have $q_2(\infty)\cong\bigcup\limits_{s\in S} q(x_s)$ (where we have the coproduct in $C$ here and the $x_s$ corresponding to the final vertices of the $\Delta^{n+1}$).
        So for every $s\in S$ the left square in the diagram
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
                {
                    p(x_s) & p_2(\infty) & p(\infty)\\
                    q(x_s) & q_2(\infty) & q(\infty)\\};
                \path[-stealth]
    
                (m-1-1) edge (m-1-2)
                (m-1-1) edge (m-2-1)
                (m-2-1) edge (m-2-2)
                (m-1-2) edge (m-2-2)
                (m-1-2) edge (m-1-3)
                (m-2-2) edge (m-2-3)
                (m-1-3) edge (m-2-3);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        is pullback by the pasting law, thus by universality for coproducts $p_2(\infty)\cong\bigcup\limits_{s\in S} p(x_s)$ and in particular $p_2$ is a colimit cone.
        By %HTT Proposition 4.4.2.2.
        we know that 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
                {
                  q_0(\infty) & q_1(\infty)\\
                  q_2(\infty) & q(\infty)\\};
                \path[-stealth]
    
                (m-1-1) edge (m-1-2)
                (m-1-1) edge (m-2-1)
                (m-2-1) edge (m-2-2)
                (m-1-2) edge (m-2-2);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        is a pushout square, so the cube corresponding to a natural transformation $\beta\in\Fun\left(\left(\Lambda_0^2\right)^{\rhd},C\right)_1$
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = .5 cm]
                p|_{X^{\rhd}}(\infty) \arrow [dr] \arrow [rr] \arrow [dd] & & p|_{\left(K^n\right)^{\rhd}}(\infty) \arrow [dr] \arrow [dd] \\
                & p|_{Y^{\rhd}}(\infty) \arrow [rr, crossing over] \arrow [dd] & & p(\infty) \arrow [dd] & \\
                q|_{X^{\rhd}}(\infty) \arrow [dr] \arrow [rr] & & q|_{\left(K^n\right)^{\rhd}}(\infty) \arrow [dr] \\
                & q|_{Y^{\rhd}}(\infty) \arrow [from=uu, crossing over] \arrow [rr] & & q(\infty) &
            \end{tikzcd}
        \end{center}
        is cartesian.
        By universality for pushouts (since the bottom square is pushout) we thus have that the top square is also a pushout.
        Again by %HTT Proposition 4.4.2.2.
        it thus follows that $p(\infty)$ is a colimit cone.

        It now remains to show that statement for general $K$.
        Let $L\subset\N(\Nat)$ (where we view $\Nat$ as a category $0\to1\to2\to3\ldots$) be the simplicial subset containing all $0$-simplices and only the $1$-simplices which are between consecutive integers (so all higher simplices are degenerate).
        It can be shown that the inclusion $L\subset\N(\Nat)$ is a categorical equivalence. %TODO maybe more detail, colimits can be computed as colimits over \N(\Nat) and skeletal filtration

        Let $\alpha\colon p\to q\in\Fun(K^{\rhd},C)_1$ be a cartesian transformation and let $q$ be a colimit cone and let $\left(K^n\right)_{n\in\Nat}$ denote the skeletal filtration of $K$.
        We can compute colimits over $K$ by computing the colimit of the diagram $\N(\Nat)\to C$ that for each $0$-simplex is the colimit of the skeleton of corresponding degree and all higher simplicies are given by chains of the canonical maps. 

        Since $L\subset\N(\Nat)$ is a categorical equivalence (which preserve and reflect (co)limits), we can also compute the colimit of the induced diagram $L\to C$.

        So let $F_q\colon L^{\rhd}\to C$ be the diagram induced by taking colimits of the skeleta as above.
        Let $F_p\colon L^{\rhd}\to C$ be given on the $0$-simplices by taking pullbacks
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
                {
                  F_p(n) & F_q(n)\\
                  p(\infty)=F_p(\infty) & F_q(\infty)=q(\infty)\\};
                \path[-stealth]
    
                (m-1-1) edge (m-1-2)
                (m-1-1) edge (m-2-1)
                (m-2-1) edge (m-2-2)
                (m-1-2) edge (m-2-2);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        and on $1$-simplices by taking canonical maps.
        Thus we get a cartesian natural transformation $\beta\colon F_p\to F_q$.
        By universality for finite dimensional $K$ we have that $F_p(n)$ is the colimit of $p|_{K^n}$.
        Since $L$ is $1$-dimensional, we have that $F_p$ is a colimit cone and thus $p(\infty)$ is the colimit of its skeleta.
        This proves that $p$ is a colimit cone and thus the proposition.
    \end{proof}
\end{lemma}
\begin{lemma}
    A \inftycat/ $C$ has descent if and only if it has descent for pushouts and coproducts. %TODO is this true? Or does one need universality?
    \begin{proof} %TODO maybe mention why it suffices to prove things for arrows x\to\infty TODO change notation p|_? to p_? and be more clear
        Let $\alpha\colon p\to q\in\Fun(K^{\rhd},C)_1$ be a map.
        We prove the statement first for all finite dimensional $K$ by induction over the dimension of $K$. %TODO define dimension

        For $\dim K=-1$ the statement is clear since $K$ is empty.

        %For $\dim K=0$ we have that $K\cong\bigcup\limits_{i\in I}\Delta^0$ for some small set $I$. 
        %In this case the statement is also clear since all maps are identity maps.

        So let $\dim K=n+1$.
        Then by the skeletal filtration, $K=K^{n+1}=K^n\bigcup\limits_{\cup_S \partial\Delta^{n+1}}\cup_S \Delta^{n+1}$ where $S$ is the set of non-degenerate simplicies of dimension $n+1$.
        For ease of notation, we set $X=\cup_S \partial\Delta^{n+1}$ and $Y=\cup_S \Delta^{n+1}$.

        By induction hypothesis and because $C$ admits small colimits, we obtain that $\alpha|_{\left(K^n\right)^{\rhd}}$, $\alpha|_{X^{\rhd}}$ are cartesian (where we abuse the notation of restriction, since it it not necessarily injective for $X$ and the conepoints which are the colimits are not necessarily in $K^{\rhd}$).

        The map $\alpha|_{Y^{\rhd}}$ is cartesian as well: Since $\Delta^{n+1}$ has a terminal object, the colimit can be computed by evaluating the final vertex. 
        In particular, the maps to the cone point are isomorphisms.
        Then one uses descent for coproducts.

        By %HTT Proposition 4.4.2.2.
        we know that the canonical diagrams in $C$

        \end{center}
        are pullbacks: 

        For all $x\in X_0$ we have that the outer (by descent for $\alpha|_{\left(K^n\right)^{\rhd}}$) and right square of the diagram
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}

                (m-1-3) edge (m-2-3);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        are pullback, so by the pasting law the left square is as well. 
        By universality, this implies that $q|_{X^{\rhd}}(\infty)\times_{q|_{\left(K^n\right)^{\rhd}}(\infty)}p|_{\left(K^n\right)^{\rhd}}(\infty)$ is a colimit of $p|_X$ and thus equivalent to $p|_{X^{\rhd}}(\infty)$.
        The other square follows analogously.

        Thus the natural transformation $\beta\colon\left(\Lambda_0^2\right)^{\rhd}\times\Delta^1\to C$ represented by the diagram
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzcd} [sep = .5 cm]

                & p|_{Y^{\rhd}}(\infty) \arrow [rr, crossing over] \arrow [dd] & & p(\infty) \arrow [dd] & \\
                q|_{X^{\rhd}}(\infty) \arrow [dr] \arrow [rr] & & q|_{\left(K^n\right)^{\rhd}}(\infty) \arrow [dr] \\
                & q|_{Y^{\rhd}}(\infty) \arrow [from=uu, crossing over] \arrow [rr] & & q(\infty) &
            \end{tikzcd}

        is cartesian because $C$ has descent for pushouts.

        Since every object $x\in K$ already lies in the image of either $K^n$ or $Y$, the map $p(x)\to p(\infty)$ always factors as $p|_{K^n}(x)\to p|_{\left(K^n\right)^{\rhd}}(\infty)\to p(\infty)$ or $p|_{Y}(x)\to p|_{Y^{\rhd}}(\infty)\to p(\infty)$ where it follows by descent for $\alpha|_{\left(K^n\right)^{\rhd}}$ or $\alpha|_{Y^{\rhd}}$ respectively.

        The case for arbitrary $K$ follows from the following facts:

        Let $L\subset\N(\Nat)$ (where we view $\Nat$ as a category $0\to1\to2\to3\ldots$) be the simplicial subset containing all $0$-simplices and only the $1$-simplices which are between consecutive integers (so all higher simplices are degenerate).
        It can be shown that the inclusion $L\subset\N(\Nat)$ is a categorical equivalence. %TODO maybe more detail, colimits can be computed as colimits over \N(\Nat) and skeletal filtration

        So let $\alpha\colon p\to q$ be a natural transformation between colimit cones $p,q\colon K^{\rhd}\to C$ such that $\alpha|_K$ is cartesian.
        Let $K^n\subset K$ denote the $n$-th skeleton.
        Let $F_p\colon L^{\rhd}\to C$ be the functor that is the colimit of $K^n\xrightarrow{p|_{K^n}}C$ for each degree, $p(\infty)$ on the cone point and a choice of canonical map on the $1$-simplices.
        Let $F_q\colon L\to C$ denote the same construction for $q$.
        Then since $L\subset\N(\Nat)$ is a categorical equivalence, the colimit of $F_p|_L$ and $F_q|_L$ are $p(\infty)$ and $q(\infty)$ respectively, so $F_p$ and $F_q$ are already colimit cones.

        By descent for finite dimensions and universality we know that for all $n\in\Nat$ the squares

                \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
                {
                  p|_{K^n}(\infty) & p|_{K^{n+1}}(\infty)\\
                  q|_{K^n}(\infty) & q|_{K^{n+1}}(\infty)\\};
                \path[-stealth]
    
                (m-1-1) edge (m-1-2)
                (m-1-1) edge (m-2-1)
                (m-2-1) edge (m-2-2)
                (m-1-2) edge (m-2-2);

        \end{center}
        are pullback, so the induced transformation $\beta\colon F_p\to F_q$ is cartesian when restricted to $L$.
        Since $L$ is $1$-dimensional, again from descent we have that $\beta$ is cartesian.
        This shows that for all $n\in\Nat$ the square
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
                {
                  p|_{K^n}(\infty) & p(\infty)\\
                  q|_{K^n}(\infty) & q(\infty)\\};
                \path[-stealth]

                (m-2-1) edge (m-2-2)
                (m-1-2) edge (m-2-2);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        is cartesian.

        We want to show that 
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
                {
                  p(x) & p(\infty)\\
                  q(x) & q(\infty)\\};
                \path[-stealth]
    
                (m-1-1) edge (m-1-2)
                (m-1-1) edge (m-2-1)
                (m-2-1) edge (m-2-2)
                (m-1-2) edge (m-2-2);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        is a pullback for a all $x\in K_0$. 
        But every such $x$ already is in some $K^n$, so we obtain a factorization
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \matrix (m) [matrix of math nodes,row sep=3em,column sep=4em,minimum width=2em]
                {
                    p(x)=p|_{K^n}(x) & p|_{K^n}(\infty) & p(\infty)\\
                    q(x)=q|_{K^n}(x) & q|_{K^n}(\infty) & q(\infty)\\};
                \path[-stealth]
    
                (m-1-1) edge (m-1-2)
                (m-1-1) edge (m-2-1)
                (m-2-1) edge (m-2-2)
                (m-1-2) edge (m-2-2)
                (m-1-2) edge (m-1-3)
                (m-2-2) edge (m-2-3)
                (m-1-3) edge (m-2-3);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        where the left square is pullback by descent for finite dimensions. 
        Thus the outer square cartesian, proving the propsition.

    Let $C$ be an \inftycat/ fulfilling the following properties:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $C$ is locally presentable.
        \item $C$ has universal colimits.
        \item $C$ has descent.
    \end{itemize}
    Then we call $C$ an \emph{\infty-topos}.
